Introduction
------------

Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are specific probability
distributions over clouds of points that have been popular as models or
computational tools across physics, probability, statistics, and more
recently of booming interest in machine learning. Sampling from DPPs is
a nontrivial matter, and many approaches have been proposed. DPPy is a
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ library that puts together all
exact and approximate sampling algorithms for DPPs.

Requirements
------------

DPPy works with `Python 3.4+ <http://docs.python.org/3/>`__

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__
-  `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__
-  `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__
-  `Networkx <http://networkx.github.io/>`__ to play with `uniform
   spanning
   trees <https://dppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exotic_dpps/index.html#uniform-spanning-trees>`__
-  `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org>`__ to use the ``zono_sampling`` MCMC
   sampler for finite DPPs. **CVXOPT itself requires**
   `GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org>`__,

   -  On MAC it comes with
      `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__
   -  On UNIX, use your package manager (``apt``, ``yum`` etc)

      .. code:: bash

          sudo apt install -qq gcc g++

Installation
------------

1. If you have a GitHub account

   -  Please consider forking DPPy
   -  Use git to clone your copy of the repo

      .. code:: bash

          cd <directory_of_your_choice>
          git clone https://github.com/<username>/DPPy.git

2. If you only use git, clone this repository

   .. code:: bash

       cd <directory_of_your_choice>
       git clone https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy.git

3. Otherwise simply dowload the project

Finally, in any case, install the project

.. code:: bash

    cd DPPy
    pip install .

Tutorial in `a Jupyter notebook <https://www.Jupyter.org/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can read and work on this interactive tutorial, directly from your
web browser, without having to download or install Python or anything.
Just click, wait a little bit, and play with the notebook!

Contribute to the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
`documentation <http://dppy.readthedocs.io/>`__
is generated locally with
`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ and then built online
by `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/projects/dppy/>`__.

If you wish to contribute to the documentation or just play with it
locally, you can:

-  Install Sphinx

   .. code:: bash

       pip install -U sphinx

-  Generate the docs locally

   .. code:: bash

       cd DPPy/docs
       make html

-  Open the local HTML version of the documentation located at
   ``DPPy/docs/_build/html/index.html``

   .. code:: bash

       open _build/html/index.html

If you wish pull request your contribution, please use the ``docs``
branch.
